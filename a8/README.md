### Two techniques from A3-A7 and how you used them here

- The **Draw** mask uses the concept of drawing from A3. The user can draw on the screen using their index fingers.
- The **Keyboard** mask uses the concept of text-to-speech from A6. The user can point at a letter with either index finger and the letter will be spoken.

### Which was your favorite mask that you made, and why?

The **Keyboard** mask is my favorite because it was a unique idea I came up with to incorporate text-to-speech. It's very interactive since the letters spoken are based on what the user is pointing at, and the user can see the string of letters they have pointed at so far to form a word.

# Mask 1

### Describe this mask

The **Draw** mask allows the user to draw on the screen using their index fingers. A wave radiates from the user's face in the same color as their drawing.

### What three additional controls did you add? Why would the user want to adjust that?

- `size`: the user can change the size of the brush to change the thickness of their drawing
- `trail length`: the user can change how long the trail of the brush is to retain more or less of the drawing
- `color`: the user can change the color of the brush to change the color of their drawing

### What did you do for the hands and the environment? Why is that the right choice for this mask?

Because the drawing brush color is very bright, I used the neon hands from the starter "rainbar" mask. The background is kept black to make the neon colors stand out. These choices allow for the drawing to stand out alongside the hands and mask.

### What secondary motion does this mask have? How does the tracking data affect this motion?

The radiation from the face is secondary motion, and it is affected by the position of the face. The drawing is also secondary motion, and it is affected by the position of the hands.

### Of the ontology in class (mirror, mask, puppet, costume, environment, dance partner) which one(s) best describe this mask and why?

The mask can be best described as an **environment** because the neon hands, drawing brush, and radiation all build an environment of neon lights that the user can immerse themselves within.

# Mask 2

### Describe this mask

The **Keyboard** mask allows the user to point at letters to form a word. The letters are spoken as they are pointed at. The last letter also circles around the user's face.

### What three additional controls did you add? Why would the user want to adjust that?

- `count`: the user can change the number of letters that are circled around the face to create a cool effect and emphasize the last letter the user pointed at
- `delay`: the user can change the delay between letters being spoken to customize the time they are allowed to move their hand to point at the next letter
- `show length`: the user can change the length of the string of letters displayed at the bottom to customize how much of the word they have pointed at so far is shown

### What did you do for the hands and the environment? Why is that the right choice for this mask?

I used a black-and-white color scheme for the hands, the face, and the background to simulate writing black text on a piece of white paper. Because this mask focuses on writing text, this choice is appropriate.

### What secondary motion does this mask have? How does the tracking data affect this motion?

The circling of the last letter is secondary motion, and it is affected by the position of the face.

### Of the ontology in class (mirror, mask, puppet, costume, environment, dance partner) which one(s) best describe this mask and why?

The mask can be best described as a **puppet** because the user can control the letters that are spoken and the circling of the last letter.

### What is one new skill that you gained during this project?

I learned how to use face tracking and hand tracking in combination with p5.js.
