## Describe the 6 gifs you made, and what tools each used

1. **dispersion**: rectangles with random colors, random positions, random velocities, and random sizes spawn, move around the screen for a bit, then shrink and fade away.
2. **rainy day**: clouds with random positions set once appear, with raindrops with random horizontal positions, random vertical velocities falling from them.
3. **self portrait**: a wobbly circle blob with a face on it using noise to shift each vertex randomly.
4. **blink**: a single black ellipse blinks naturally by becoming a line, sometimes shedding a tear emoji.
5. **sick beat**: an audio waveform visualizer that simulates a custom beat over time.
6. **countdown**: a rainbow timer bounces around the screen leaving a trail, which is cleared when it hits 0.

## What P5 method or technique did you enjoy using the most? What was interesting to you about it?

The `noise()` function was really interesting to use. I used it to make the wobbly blob in my self portrait, which was pretty cool.

## Did you find any P5 functionality that wasn't covered in class?

Building the wobbly blob wasn't covered, but that ended up looking pretty cool.

## How did you get your looping gif to loop smoothly? What was hard or easy about that techinque?

The looping gif ("sick beat") was made to visualize the same beat on repeat. Using a two-dimensional of amplitudes over time, I was able to make a waveform that would loop smoothly. The hardest part was getting the timing right, but I think it turned out pretty well.

## Does the self-portrait "look like you"? What is missing? What worked well?

It has brown skin and is smiling. It doesn't have much other features but the motion looks cool. It's an abstract self-portrait.

## What is one new skill that you gained during this project?

I gained the ability to use p5.js to make animated GIFs.
