## Which is your best space?

**PB&J**

---

## Space 1

### What kinds of things does this space make?:

**Eclipse** has individuals that each consists of a sun with a moon that can cover it.

### What are each of the dimensions for this, and what do they control

- `sunSize`: radius of the sun
- `sunX`: horizontal position of the sun
- `sunY`: vertical position of the sun
- `moonSize`: radius of the moon
- `moonX`: horizontal position of the moon
- `moonY`: vertical position of the moon

### What expected kinds of these things are _not_ in this space? (ie, what might someone expect this to generate, but its not part of your system)

The sun does not glow with light and the moon does not have craters.

### Is this space completely continuous, or does it have discontinuities (ie, number of flower petals jumping between integers, or if statements)

This space is discontinuous because the sun and moon are separate entities.

### What are your landmarks, and why did you pick those?

- `eclipse`: shows the sun and moon being aligned most realistically
- `orbit`: shows the moon orbiting the sun even though that's not realistic
- `no sun`: shows the moon covering the sun completely
- `tiny moon`: shows the moon being very small in comparison to the sun
- `both`: shows an equal-sized sun and moon together

## Space 2

### What kinds of things does this space make?:

**PB&J** has individuals that each consists of a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich.

### What are each of the dimensions for this, and what do they control

- `breadSize`: size of the slices of bread
- `breadSpacing`: spacing between the slices of bread
- `breadDensity`: opacity of the slices of bread
- `peanutButterAmount`: how much of one slice of bread is covered in peanut butter
- `jellyAmount`: how much of one slice of bread is covered in jelly
- `jellyFlavor`: the color of the jelly

### What expected kinds of these things are _not_ in this space? (ie, what might someone expect this to generate, but its not part of your system)

The bread does not have any texture and is quite sharp.

### Is this space completely continuous, or does it have discontinuities (ie, number of flower petals jumping between integers, or if statements)

This space is continuous because the bread, peanut butter, and jelly are all part of one entity.

### What are your landmarks, and why did you pick those?

- `grape jelly`: shows the jelly being purple
- `pb addict`: shows super translucent bread with one side covered in a lot of peanut butter
- `breadless`: shows just peanut butter and jelly on basically no bread
- `pb and mustard`: shows the peanut butter being yellow
- `plain bread`: shows bread without any peanut butter or jelly

## Space 3

### What kinds of things does this space make?:

**Pumpkins** takes on the Halloween vibe and has individuals that each consists of a bouncing pumpkin, based partly on the starter "rectangles" space.

### What are each of the dimensions for this, and what do they control

- `size`: size of the pumpkin
- `anger`: anger level of the pumpkin
- `bounceSize`: bounce height of the pumpkin
- `bounceSpeed`: bounce speed of the pumpkin
- `angle`: angle of the pumpkin
- `stemHue`: hue of the pumpkin stem

### What expected kinds of these things are _not_ in this space? (ie, what might someone expect this to generate, but its not part of your system)

The pumpkins do not have much texture or accurately-colored stems.

### Is this space completely continuous, or does it have discontinuities (ie, number of flower petals jumping between integers, or if statements)

This space is continuous because the pumpkin and its components are all part of one entity.

### What are your landmarks, and why did you pick those?

- `classic`: shows a classic pumpkin with a green stem
- `chonky`: shows a very large pumpkin bouncing slowly
- `nervous`: shows a nervous-looking pumpkin bouncing quickly at a low height
- `angry`: shows an angry-looking pumpkin bouncing quickly at a high height
- `tiny`: shows a very small pumpkin bouncing slowly at a high height

### What is one new skill that you gained during this project?

I worked more with using p5.js to simulate a somewhat 3D environment, primarily in the **PB&J** space.
