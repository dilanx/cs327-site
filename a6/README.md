## What Tracery grammar did you make? What does it generate?

**Tech Support** uses Tracery grammar to build more natural greetings and farewells for a tech support chatbot.

## What two complexifiers did you use? Describe how you used them, and what effect they have on your bot

- **Emotional Bot** speaks its messages. While the bot just uses a single tone, it allows the user to hear the bot and feel more connected to it.
- **Emotional Bot** uses a p5 canvas to show its emotion, allowing the user to see the bot's face and feel more connected to it.

## Look up the Gricean maxims. Do your bots obey them? Why or why not?

The bots partially obey the Gricean maxims.

- **Quantity**: bots do not give too much or too little information
- **Quality**: while **Emotional Bot** is truthful, **Tech Support** does not help much with the user's tech problem
- **Relation**: all information is relevant to the conversation
- **Manner**: bots send messages briefly and clearly

## Which bot do you like more?

I like **Tech Support** more because it enacts a humorous and relatable scenario.

# Bot #1

## What should the user know about interacting with this bot (turn on sound, keywords to use, etc)

**Tech Support** simulates a tech support conversation. The user can type things like "my computer is not working" or "my phone is not connecting to printer" or other similar tech problems.

## Describe your bot's character

The bot is a tech support worker who is not very helpful. It will ask you to restart your device, and if it still does not work, it will grab its supervisor, who will also not be very helpful.

## How does your bot listen, think, and speak?

The bot listens for keywords in the user's message. It stores the keywords in memory, waits for a second to simulate thinking, and then responds with a message, referencing the keywords as necessary, to attempt to solve the problem.

## How have your styled your page to best present this character? What scene or mood are you suggesting?

The page is styled to look like a mobile chat application. It invokes a realistic, techy mood.

## Describe the first thing this bot can respond to. What is the expressive range of what you say in response?

The bot can respond to several different options, like "my computer is not working". The response is a message that attempts to solve the problem by asking if the user already restarted their device.

## Describe the second thing this bot can respond to

The user can respond to the bot's question where it asked if the user already restarted their device. If they say no, the bot will suggest that they do so and will wait for a response about whether it worked or not.

## Describe the third thing this bot can respond to

If the user says that they already restarted their device, or if the user says that they restarted their device and it still does not work, the bot will grab its supervisor.

# Bot #2

## What should the user know about interacting with this bot (turn on sound, keywords to use, etc)

**Emotional Bot** asks how you're feeling and will match your mood so you can be happy, sad, or whatever other emotion together. Turn on sound to hear its voice as it sends messages. It also shows its emotion on the canvas above the chat.

## Describe your bot's character

The bot is a supporting friend who relates to all of your emotions. It will match your emotions and sometimes explain why it feels the same way.

## How does your bot listen, think, and speak?

The bot listens by providing the user with exact emotion keywords in the form of buttons, then handling the emotion the user selects. It shows its emotion on its canvas, while its thinking, then sends a response that it says out loud.

## How have your styled your page to best present this character? What scene or mood are you suggesting?

The page is styled so that the bot's canvas is an extension to your mobile chat application. It appears at the top to be easily visible. It invokes a friendly and supportive mood.

## Describe the first thing this bot can respond to. What is the expressive range of what you say in response?

Selecting "sad" will make the bot sad with you. The bot will invite you to be sad together.

## Describe the second thing this bot can respond to

Selecting "excited" will make the bot get excited with you. The bot will be ready to party.

## Describe the third thing this bot can respond to

Selecting "loved" will make the bot happy that you feel that way. The bot will say how it loves feeling that way.
